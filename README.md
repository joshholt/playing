###A Simple venture into the world of Play and Scala

I'm not quite sure what this is going to be but I'm going
to try to use the Cloud9 IDE to do it.

### What you need

1. Java >= 6
2. `curl -O http://download.playframework.org/releases/play-2.0.2.zip`
3. `unzip play-2.0.2.zip`
4. `export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/play-2.0.2`
5. `git clone git://github.com/joshholt/playing.git`
6. `cd playing && play`
7. after the play console boots up, type `run`
8. `open http://localhost:9000`
